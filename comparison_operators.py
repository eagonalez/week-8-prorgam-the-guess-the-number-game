  # # Comparison Operators Practice #1
  #   # Create two variables (num1 and num2) with the following values: 36 and 17. Check if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool
  # num_1 = 36
  # num_2 = 17
  # print(num_1 >= num_2)
  
  #   # Comparison Operators Practice #2
  #   # Create two variables (num1 and num2):
  # num_1 = math.sqrt(25)
  # num_2 = 5
    
  #   # Inside num1, store the result of the square root of 25
  
  #   # Inside num2, store the number 5.
  
  #   # Check if num1 is equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.
  # my_bool= num_1==num_2
  # print(my_bool)

  #   # Comparison Operators Practice #3
  #   # Create two variables (num1 and num2):
  # num_1 = 64 * 3
  # num_2 = 24 * 8
  #   # Inside num1, store the result of 64 x 3
  
  #   # Inside num2, store the result of 24 x 8
  
  #   # Check if num1 is different from num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool
  # my_bool= num_1!=num_2
  # print(my_bool)
